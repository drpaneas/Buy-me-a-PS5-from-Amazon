## Overview

A bot written in Go that hopefully buys you a PS5 from Amazon.de when it's available.
Sadly, scalpers (people using bots) are much more successful than a regular human customer (like myself) at buying limited products, such as the PS5.
The bots are so quick, they can buy a PS5 within seconds from the time it becomes available, so a normal person has no chance beating them in speed.
This is why I wrote this bot, so I can fight this injustice, making the resale market more fair, having my bot competing their bots.
